# Five-Day-Forecast
Weather Forecast Application
A five day forecast weather app made for travelers to check weather on the go. With this application you can easily check the current weather by searching for a city and it will show you the five day forecast as well for that city you entered. There is also a small selection of major cities for weather checking convenience.  Author is myself, Martin Renteria. Here is a link to the deployed application as well as a screenshot.
